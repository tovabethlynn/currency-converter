#Currency Converter

Frontend Challenge Question V: 
Create a currency converter by utilizing data from the fixer.io API.

The currency converter must include a currency selector at the top to use as the base currency and display updated currency rates based on the selected base currency. When a user taps on a currency, a calculation view should appear with the selected currency and base currency. Only the base currency field should be editable.

Feel free to use any open source libraries.
